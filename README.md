# cross-border_collaboration
I got interested in which pairs of countries collaborate the most in lifesciences, so I scraped author affiliations from pubmed, extracted their countries, identified international collaborations, and tallied them up.

This repo doesn't contain the raw data (too large).

See cross-border_collaboration.pdf for the main result.
